ProjectSimpleMail
Version 1.0

BUILD:
 javac -d bin -cp lib/* src/*.java

RUN:
java -cp "bin;lib/dependency1.jar;lib/dependency2.jar" SimpleMail

OTHER NOTES:
You may or may not experience the icon in the application window depending on
your OS distribution, the version of your JRE, and your preferences defined 
in your JVM settings.

The icon file is located in the data/ directory and may be substituted with any
other icon granted that the filename and location stays the same.

Suggested configurations apply only to a computer on Clemson's campus network
tigernet.  They are as follows:

SMTP Server: smtp.clemson.edu
Main Email: [your username]@g.clemson.edu

Note:  If you delete the contents of the data folder, you will lose all of your
contact and configuration data.  This is not recoverable from the scope of this
application.

If the icon file is absent from the data folder, you will experience an error
message on application initialization.

User experiences of the UI will vary depending on JRE versions and OS
 distributions.
